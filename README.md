# LLMigrator
MultiThread ECM OpenText content server migrator to SharePoint online - tested with version v16 
First "dirty" version of migration script from Opentext Content Server to SharePoint using PowerShell PNP Framework and REST API + SQL queries to Content Server. 
i will cleanup code in the future. Script worked relatively fine, some minor issues are still there - handling special characters(bug of pnp framework), files > 300Mb not uploaded correctly  
Posting as it is, Use it without varanties :-]
